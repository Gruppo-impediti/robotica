# ROBOTICA
This repository contains code for the "Controllo dei robot" exam. 

In each sub-folder there is a file _contents.txt_ with a simple description of the files. 

The structure of repository is organized as follows:

# Progetto
## Mass_spring_damper system
It contains motivational examples and preliminary tasks representing the end-effector of a generic manipulator when an impedance control is used.
The three tasks are:
* grasping: lifting of an object;
* interaction: desired trajectory goes through an obstacle;
* instability: choice of variable impedance gains that make the system unstable.

## RR
The equivalent of MDS system but implemented on a RR arm.
The preliminary tasks are then merged into a task in which the object is grasped, lifted and then placed on a shelf. 

## Franka
The franka folder contains files for the simulation of the last task, grasping and placement.

# Tavole
Tavole contains the code and simulations about nonlinear analysis and control system.
